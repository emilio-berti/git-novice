# Introduction to git and GitHub, for a fool proof programming

This is the repository for a course given at iDiv March 24th 2022.
It aims to give an introduction to the terminal, git, and GitHub for people who
never had experiences with it.

## Course Material

It heavily on material from the Software Carpentry
[Git for novices lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
we're grateful for that.

We modified some of the material and added some episodes on:

* [Using git with the iDiv cluster EVE](https://emilio-berti.github.io/idiv-git-introduction/19-git_on_eve/index.html),
* [Obtaining a Zenodo DOI from a GitHub repository](https://emilio-berti.github.io/idiv-git-introduction/21-github_zenodo/index.html),
* [Leveraging some features of GitHub to better explore your own code](https://emilio-berti.github.io/idiv-git-introduction/22-github-navigating-code/index.html).
