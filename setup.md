## Installing git

The main purpose of the course is to teach git. To install git download the program and follow the instructions [on the official git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can also see [this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup]
for instructions on installing Git. Please install it before the workshop, so that we can focus on explaining how it works. If you have trouble installing git, send us an email and we'll help you install it.


## Pre-workshop Survey

Please fill the [pre-workshop survey](https://picsoung.typeform.com/to/kfUc1f7i) (4 questions, 5 min), this would help us know better what is your previous knowledge and let you choose between additional topics that you would like to be covered.


## Time and Location

The workshop will be in-person, starting at **9:30 pm** on **Thursday 24th** in the **Beehive Room** (ground floor of iDiv main building). The course will end the same day at **5:00 pm**.


## Material needed

To follow the workshop you'll need a computer with git installed (see above). We will also use RStudio git pane, so please install RStudio. Finally you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), if you don't have one, please create one.
